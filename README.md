## What is Anidex?
Anidex is an anime progress tracking app that allows you to keep track of and maintain an updated list of your animes. Gone are the dreadful days of forgetting which season and episode you left off at, and no more notepad files and excel spreadsheets! Anidex grants you access to your list from any internet-connected device. Within your list is an overview of the name of an anime and its completion status. Additionally, you are able to view specific details about an anime in your list such as the studio, current episode, current season, and release year. Your list is yours to command! Edit specific details and/or delete animes and notes you no longer wish to keep. Never forget your anime progress again!
